              "Tommy has been my barber for many years now. My first impression
              was that he was very personable, professional, and provided a
              level of customer service rarely seen in any customer service
              industry. I appreciate the fact that he not only remembered my
              name but remembered the length and style of haircut I like. Now he
              owns His own Barbershop and I still continue to visit him for my
              cuts in his new shop."

              haircut is the best I have ever had! Jason was full of enthusiasm,
              was more than happy to offer the fresh cut for me and he even
              suggested a complimentary beverage - what more could I want?!"

              "Without any doubt, this is the best and high-end barbershop in
              San Francisco. After many unsuccessful attempts to find the
              special place that will meet my barbering needs, I've eventually
              found Tommy The Barbershop. Now I am a regular client for more
              than 4 years. Each member of their team is highly professional.
              It's really cool here!"

              "Had an appointment with Andrew a couple of weeks ago. He brought
              out the iPad and we looked through a collection of styles for me
              to choose from. I chose a James Dean type of look, saw the
              finished product, and then changed my mind and wanted to go even
              shorter. No problem at all. Andrew was very nice and professional
              and clearly understands hair. I have chosen Andrew because a
              friend recommended him to me and it turned out to be a solid
              recommendation!"
